<p>
    The CDK Community Day organizers are dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant feeling unsafe, insecure, or otherwise frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

        - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
        - Focusing on what is best for everyone at the event
