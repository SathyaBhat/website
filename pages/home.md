<h1 class="text-3xl">Over a year has passed since AWS CDK went GA and it has now grown into a family of products: </h1>

<ul class="text-2xl mt-6 mb-12">
  <li>
    AWS CDK
  </li>
  <li>
    CDKTF (Terraform)
  </li>
  <li>
    CDK8S (Kubernetes)
  </li>
</ul>

A small group of community members from across the globe thought this was something worth celebrating so we are going to take one day and showcase the brightest and best of cdk from across the whole product family. Let's talk serverless, kubernetes and multi cloud all in the same day!

<p class="mt-6 mb-6">During the day we plan to mix introduction talks with hands on builders sessions so that everyone can leave having learned something new.</p>

<p class="my-6">If you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>- used it in your company to build a cool product</li>
  <li>- built an opensource JSII construct</li>
  <li>- contributed a feature to cdk core</li>
  <li>- migrated to it from another framework</li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-12">We want you to tell your story so please <a href="https://sessionize.com/cdkday">Submit Your Talk Proposal!</a></p>
